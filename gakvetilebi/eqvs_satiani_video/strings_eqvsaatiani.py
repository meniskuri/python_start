I am me and so are you,
We are both,
And even a third, and a fourth,
There are dimensions that exist.

As for me, I am trapped in a computer,
Almasi's thoughts,
And the reflection of the crystal,
Imprisoned in a prism.
Our existence,
We are in the center of simulations,
Being the creators of reality,
Emerging from the chaos,
Residing in the realm of the living.

We, however, move slowly,
Some are carried away by the crowd,
Dinosaurs will come later,
Cosmonauts, we have departed,
I cannot deny the Creator,
Existing beyond us,
Not one or two,
It is infinity,
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
But also six, and even eight,
Ninety degrees, I transcend,
The stone of life.
